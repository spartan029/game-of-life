C# implementation of Conway's game of life

This is a little pet project I've always wanted to implement.

For more info on Conway's Game of Life: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway's_Game_of_Life

In this implementation, the grid is not infinite ;)
any cell outside of the grid, ceases to exist.

Go ahead and hop into the source if you want to play around with the seed!
